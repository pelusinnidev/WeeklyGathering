## Our Schedule 📆

We are committed to bringing you fresh and stimulating content every Friday. While our aim is to maintain this regularity, we understand that student life sometimes presents unexpected challenges. So, whenever possible, you can expect a new episode to accompany your weekend.

## Our Topics 🎙️

While we have a special passion for everything related to Apple, our curiosity knows no bounds. We enjoy discussing technology in its broadest sense: from mobile devices to computers, through artificial intelligence, and everything technology can reach. If it's innovative, if it's disruptive, if it's exciting, it will be on our radar. Plus, we'll have guests joining us, from our friends to experts in different areas.

## About Us 🤩

We are students with a profound enthusiasm for technology and a burning desire to explore every corner of the digital world. This project is our adventure, a journey that we hope will be both successful and incredibly fun for everyone who joins us. We embark on "Weekly Gathering" with great excitement, effort, and dedication, committing to offer our best in every episode.
